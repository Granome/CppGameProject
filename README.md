This it simple 2d game written on c++ sfml library.
All the code is devided in cpp and header classes.
Unfortunatelly this game does not have any sounds, as some sound libraries did not work on Windows with my compiler.
Here you can watch a demo of my game:

All the textures are included and all the paths are relative in code, no need to change them. 
SFML library needs to be installed and included for compiling.
